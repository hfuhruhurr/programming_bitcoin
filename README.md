Going through Jimmy Song's _Programming Bitcoin_ book, coding everything from scratch.

Yeah, I know, I could clone his repo but I learn very little from just executing others' code.

But there are several occasions where copying stuff (eg, 64 digit numbers) is preferable than typing it in.  For that, snag it from the [book's repo](https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin).
